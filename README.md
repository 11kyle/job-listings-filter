## My process

- Planning: My planning for this small project was minimal. I didn't document a project plan.
- Analysis: I selected which languages, frameworks and foundations to use. They are TailwindCSS, Create React App, GitHub Pages. I've been focusing on learning TailwindCSS and that's why is chose it over others like Bootstrap.
- Development: Used VS Code as my IDE. I have experience with MacOS and Windows but chose Windows for this project.
- Testing: Included opening the project in multiple browers and different screen sizes. Also, tested on my iPhone with Safari and Google Chrome by hosting my solution on Github Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to loading images in react from a json file.
The images need to be place inside the public directory but can also be within a sub directory.

The syntax for the json file is:

"logo": "./images/photosnap.svg",

You don't need to change directory out of the folder that the json is located.
